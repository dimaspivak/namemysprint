Sprint Names
============

This package is a waste of my time, but can be run to generate the name
of your team's next sprint. It does so by combining a random adjective
and a random name (chosen from a list of pro cyclists).

Installation
============

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install .

Usage
=====

Once installed, run the included script to get a sprint name:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sprint_names
    Your next sprint should be called Thirsty Cavendish.
